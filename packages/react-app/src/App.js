    heading: 'Why Decentralized Hosting important for Web3?',
    content: 'The internet has been around for some time now. However, much of its fluid nature is now controlled and censored by governments and corporates. But nowadays the internet is in the middle of a revolution: centralized proprietary services are being replaced with decentralized solutions and monolithic services replaced with peer-to-peer algorithmic systems. Here comes the Decentralized Hosting solution, which can revolutionize how traditional web hosting services work. With peer-to-peer content delivery networks, hosting a web application now can be easily done without a centralized system. With the advent of Web3.0 technologies, it is now more than ever important to decentralize frontend applications without a centralized entity controlling their hosted site and takedown at any moment.
